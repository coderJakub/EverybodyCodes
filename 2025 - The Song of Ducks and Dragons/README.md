# 🧩 Everybody Codes 2025 
This directory contains my solutions for the coding challenge event [Everybody Codes 2025: The Song of Ducks and Dragons](https://everybody.codes/event/2025/quests). Each day's challenge is organized into its own folder, with separate files for each part of the challenge. I used mostly `Python` to solve the challenges.

## 🚀 Running the solutions:
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- to be able to download the input files you have to create a file `cookie.txt` in this directory and put in your session cookie from everybody.codes 
    - you can find your session cookie by pressing `F12` in your browser, going to the `Application` tab, and looking for the `session` cookie under `Cookies` for the `everybody.codes` domain.

### Instructions    
```bash
python runDay.py <day>
```
- Replace `<day>` with the day number you want to run (e.g., `9`, `22`).
- you can also run a specific part of a day by providing a second argument:
    - if you want to run it with a personal testcase specified in `test.txt` you can add a third argument `t`
```bash
python runDay.py <day> <part> [t]
```
